# üåüOOP_Project_flappyBird
The game is simply manipulating a bird through the pipes and not touching the tube or falling to the ground every time you get through a pipe. Although the game is extremely simple, it once occupied the top 1 downloads on the Appstore and gained many players' addictions.
## üí° Game Idea
- The bird can move up and down through the empty spaces of two pillars, speed and altitude that the birds achieve will depend on how the player clicks the mouse (more or less). 
- Each time passing a column, the player will get 1 point. At the same time, the columns will move to the left of the playing screen, each time a column hits the border, a new column will appear on the right of the playing screen. 
- The distance and space between the two columns are fixed, however the height (position) of the gap will be randomly generated.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Feature
Main feature
- Control the bird to fly high or low, fast or slow.
- Score points.

Extra features (updating)
- Shows the bird's status in advance. 
--> For example, if the bird hit a pipe, the game screen will show the message "Oops, you hit the pipe"; or if you pass the pipe, let say "Awesome"; or nearly touch the pipe, maybe say "√ât-o-√©t".
- Choose different bird style.
