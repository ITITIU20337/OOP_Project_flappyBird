# OOP_Project_flappyBird
The game is simply manipulating a bird through the pipes and not touching the tube or falling to the ground every time you get through a pipe. Although the game is extremely simple, it once occupied the top 1 downloads on the Appstore and gained many players' addictions.
## Game Idea
- The bird can move up and down through the empty spaces of two pillars, speed and altitude that the birds achieve will depend on how the player clicks the mouse (more or less). 
- Each time passing a column, the player will get 1 point. At the same time, the columns will move to the left of the playing screen, each time a column hits the border, a new column will appear on the right of the playing screen. 
- The distance and space between the two columns are fixed, however the height (position) of the gap will be randomly generated.
